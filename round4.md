# Assignment for Round 4
## Setting
You are hired by Amazon to analyze customer feedbacks on electronics products. In particular, the company executives wants to know how products marketed toward male or female users were received by the target audiences. 

They plan to make big business decisions based on these trends.

Be mindful that how customers feel will differ across individual products, product categories, the brand, and the time period.

## Data
Get the [customer rating data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/marketing-bias-in-product-recommendations?select=electronics.csv) from 1996-2018.

Make sure to get `electronics.csv` and **not** `modcloth.csv`

## Presentation format
Your task is to create a 2-page report. 

Be concise and precise with your writing and the figures (*your report will influence millions of dollars*). 

The figures should be clearly readable when printed on A4 paper.

## Scope of story
* How are electronics product on Amazon rated by the customers? Is there any trend in particular categories, brands, or time periods?
* How strong and how effective are the effects of gender-specific marketing?
* Are there products that are very well-recieved or very poorly-recieved by their intended gender targets?

## Other notes
The key audiences are executives who are already familiar with the objecive of your report. **You do not need to reiterate the background and objective**.

Since the executives need to make big decisions based on your report, **you must demonstrate that each of your finding is well-supported by the data**. You also have to be careful about **alternative interpretations**.

You may use either Thai or English (to prevent language from becoming a barrier).
