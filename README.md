# The 1st Data Visualization League
Hosted by [Center for AI in Medicine](https://aim.md.chula.ac.th/) at Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University

## About 
This is a pilot program for increasing skills in the art of visualization and story telling from data. The target audiences are beginners and graduate students who recently switched from a life science to a computational field.

Due to limited resource and referee availability, only selected participants will be sent the link for uploading their works, and the referees will judge and provide comments only on those submissions.

If you are interested in joining our future event, please look forward to further announcement.

`NEW` Here are some [prior submissions](https://github.com/cmb-chula/data-viz-league-pilot/blob/main/gallery.md). You may want to try creating your own works before viewing others'.

## Format
In each round, a small dataset, a presentation format, and a scope of the story to be presented will be posted.

The participants will have 2 weeks to work on the initial submission. The referee will then take 1 week to judge. Lastly, the participant will have 1 week to revise the submission according to the comments.

After a full cycle, the next round, with a new dataset and task will be assigned.

For this pilot program, we will host 4 rounds. At the end of the 4 rounds, the winner(s) will be announced.

## Rules
Participants may not work together, nor get external help, on the creation of the graphical items

`Generative AI` may be used. But the full details of such usage must be disclosed along with the submission

No late submission will be accepted

## Evaluation
Each submission will be evaluated on the 4 aspects listed below, each on a scale of 1 to 5
1. Does it adhere to the assigned scope of story?
2. Does it fit the assigned presentation format?
3.	Is it intuitive and easy to understand?
4.	Is it aesthetically well-made?
