# Assignment for Round 2
## Setting
You are commissioned by a travel agency to summarize United Kingdom's weather information (temperature and rainfall) to provide advice to tourists about when is the best time to visit.

In particular, the agency want you to produce contents that are easy to digest by everyone and should catch the eye of potential customers.

## Data
Get the [10-year UK weather summary](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryakrishnanar/average-rainfall-and-temperature-in-uk20102019) from 2010-2019.

## Presentation format
Your task is to create a half-page A4 leaflet (150 mm width x 210 mm height)

## Scope of story
* What are the annual patterns of temperature and rainfall in UK?
* When would be a good time to visit the UK?

## Other notes
The leaflet must be understandble to broad, ordinary people. It should include both graphics and texts.

In addition to generating good graphics, think about styles of the texts as well.

You may use either Thai or English (to prevent language from becoming a barrier).
