# Assignment for Round 3
## Setting
You are commissioned by Thailand's Ministry of Public Health to educate the general public of the current healthcare gaps in the country compared to its ASEAN neighbors.

In particular, the Ministry wants a clear message whether Thailand is doing well in terms of healthcare and what causes of deaths will become a new concern in the coming decade.

## Data
Get the [cause of deaths data around the world](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/cause-of-deaths-around-the-world) from 1990-2019.

You may additionally obtain [world population by countries](https://worldpopulationreview.com/).

## Presentation format
Your task is to create an A4-sized infographic. 

There can be multiple graphs and text boxes but all of them should together form a single coherent panel.

## Scope of story
* What are the primary cause of deaths in Thailand? How did they change over the past decades?
* How is Thailand doing compared to other ASEAN countries?

## Other notes
The key audiences are Thai public health officials and the general public.

Adding the right texts and the right amount of texts is essential.

You may use either Thai or English (to prevent language from becoming a barrier).
